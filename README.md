# FrontendQuiz

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Overview

FrontendQuiz is an interactive web application designed to test and improve your knowledge of front-end development. It features questions on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Accessibility to help you stay sharp in these essential areas of web development.

## How It Works

Upon navigating to the quiz page, you will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question tests your knowledge in one of four categories:

- **CSS**: Covers styles, selectors, specificity, layout techniques, and responsive design.
- **HTML**: Includes elements, attributes, semantic HTML, and best practices.
- **JavaScript**: Encompasses syntax, functions, scope, ES6 features, and common patterns.
- **Accessibility**: Focuses on ARIA roles, semantic HTML for accessibility, and best practices to ensure web content is usable by everyone.

You can select your answer for each question, and the application will provide immediate feedback. At the end of the quiz, you will receive a summary of your performance, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

## Accessing the Quiz

Visit [Frontend Quiz](https://frontendquizmoses.netlify.app.) to start the quiz. The app is accessible from any modern web browser and does not require any installation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
